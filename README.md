# Toggle Mute Input Device
## (TMID for shorts... yeah I'm not good ad naming)
I made this project to easly enable and disable the input device I use to listen to my Switch while gaming with the audio through my pc.
Feel free to use it as you like.

# How To Use It
There are two ways to run the program:
 1. Go to the release page and download the package
 2. Download/Clone the repository and build it yourself
    
If you want an easy quick way i suggest to download the release, instead, if you are concerned about the content of the exe file, run the program from the second option.

Once it starts it will use a priority system to find your device to toggle:
  1. Passing a string argument using the CLI
  2. With a "DeviceName.txt" file located in the same folder
  3. By selecting from the program itself 

If you select the device from the 3rd option the program will suggest to save the device to the "DeviceName.txt" file (the creation of the file is automatic) to make faster automation.<br>
My personal setup is a folder somewhere in the disk with both the program and the .txt file and a link to the program in the start menu. Of course you are free to make your own automation.<br>
I hope to have made it quite modular so it's relatively easy to change and adapt to your need.<br>
It's a very simple program made to start challenging myself relying on my capabilities instead of trying to find a program already made. If you have some knowledge I suggest to you to do the same.<br>
I may return to it in the future if I find myself in need to make some adjustment but for now It Justs Work™️.<br>
